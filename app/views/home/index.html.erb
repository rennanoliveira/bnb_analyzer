    <h2>The Data</h2>
    <p>
      This project aims to analyze Air Bnb data for New York City, provided by
      <%= link_to 'InsideAirBnb.com', 'insideairbnb.com/about.html' %>.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the site, this data was collected from public AirBnb listings,
      and the data used on Bnb Analyzer is a snapshot scraped on July 02, 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project also uses the Multiple Dwelling Registration data, provided by
      <%= link_to 'NYC Open Data', 'https://data.cityofnewyork.us/' %>.
    </p>
    <p>"Property owners of residential buildings are required by law to register annually with HPD if the property is a
      multiple dwelling (3+ residential units) or a private dwelling (1-2 residential units) where neither the owner nor
      the owner's immediate family resides."

    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>
      We are Jorge Felipe Campos Chagas and Rennan Maciel de Oliveira,
      two undergraduates currently studying Computer Science and Information Systems,
      respectively, on Universidade Federal Fluminense.
      This is our final project for the 'Urban Computing' class,
      co-lectured by Antonio Augusto de Arag√£o Rocha and

    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
    <p>
      Get an A+.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kidding. Well, it's that too, but our project goal is analyzing AirBnb Data, trying to extract statistics
      and check if AirBnb hosts are in compliance with New York City's strict house renting rules.
      Read more about AirBnb's privacy policy <%= link_to 'here', about_air_bnb_path %>.
      Mainly, we expect to check how many units comply to the minimum nights rule from the NYC Government and
      how many units are possibly unregistered on the city's Multiple Dwelling Registration.
      If all goes well, in the end we will also check simple statistics like average ratings by neighbourhood, etc.

    <h2>How we <i>dunnit</i></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          READ THE BNB DATA -
          We extracted a .csv file from InsideAirBnb and read it into our
          <%= link_to 'PostgreSQL Database', 'https://www.postgresql.org/' %>.
          We chose postgres due to it being open source, light, and having
          <%= link_to 'PostGIS', 'http://www.postgis.net/' %>, which aids us with spatial data (geocodes).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          NORMALIZE THE DATA -
          We created tables to help us normalize the data, relating AirBnb listings to
          <i>Neighbourhood Groups</i>, <i>Neighbourhoods</i>, <i>Room Types</i> and <i>Property Types</i>.
          This was done so we could filter the listings as we saw fit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          READ THE MULTIPLE DWELLING REGISTRATION DATA -
          We extracted a .csv file from NYC Open Data, saving it to the database.
          Quite a few enhancements had to be made to the ruby script reading the csv file,
          as not all data was standardized (iex: dates).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          NORMALIZE THE DATA... ROUND 2 -
          We associated the data with the <i>Neighbourhood Groups</i> and <i>Neighbourhoods</i> created for the BnbData,
          helping us compare data between the two.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          GEOCODE THE DATA -
          The Bnb data had <i>geocoding</i> (latitudes and longitudes), whilst NYC Data had city names and address.
          Using a ruby script, googlemaps' geocoding service and <i>api_keys</i> generated from a LOT of our
          contributers,
          we began processing the NYC Data, geocoding it.
          This script itself deserves a lengthy explanation and perhaps a mini-paper explaining all the workarounds
          regarding
          google query limits, multiple api_keys, server/connection downtime and unprocessable addresses.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          BUILD THE APP -
          A Ruby on Rails web application (this one) was created,
          to organize all the data and help us with geocoding progress, filterings,
          easy stats gerenations with any filters we required.
          This took a while, but all code was done caring for best practices,
          following SOLID patterns as well as we knew how to aid us with our rudimentary programming skills :).
          The code is available publicly on
          github, <%= link_to 'here', 'https://github.com/rennanoliveira/bnb_analyzer' %>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          CROSS THE DATA -
          Using PostGIS's spatial features, we will compare geocode data from AirBnb units,
          figuring out if there are Dwelling Registrations in a small aproximation range,
          to try and see how many AirBnbs have no active registration.
